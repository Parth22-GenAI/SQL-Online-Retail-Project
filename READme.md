# 🛒 SQL Project: Online Retail Store

This mini project simulates a simple **Online Retail Store** database using SQL. It demonstrates the practical usage of core SQL concepts including table creation, joins, aggregation, subqueries, and data manipulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Although I don't hold an official certification in SQL yet, I’ve been self-learning and applying my skills by building hands-on projects like this one. This project was created to strengthen my understanding of:

- Database schema design
- Writing complex SELECT queries
- Performing JOINs across multiple tables
- Using aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, etc.)
- Updating and deleting records
- Using subqueries and filtering results

## 📁 Files
- `online_retail_store.sql` – Contains all SQL operations

## 📊 Tables in the Project
- `Customers`
- `Products`
- `Orders`
- `OrderDetails`

## ✅ Queries Performed
- Basic SELECT statements
- INNER JOIN across multiple tables
- GROUP BY with aggregation
- Subqueries to find specific customer behaviors
- UPDATE and DELETE operations

**This project reflects my understanding and application of SQL in a realistic database structure.**

If you want to test the SQL file, you can run it in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or even in online SQL editors like [sqlfiddle.com](https://sqlfiddle.com/) or [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/).
